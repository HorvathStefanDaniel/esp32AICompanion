This is a repository for an educational "buddy" AI companion. The purpose is to teach how embedded hardware (ESP32 + microphone + speaker) can be tied with software (AI is running online) to create an IOT system.

The idea is to make 2 versions, one simpler one with Arduino IDE, and one more complex with ESP32 or PlatformIO. 

Makes use of https://github.com/zenhall/DAZI-AI for the Arduino project
