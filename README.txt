This is a repository for an educational "tutor" AI companion. The purpose of the project is to teach how embedded hardware (ESP32 + microphone + speaker) can be tied with software (AI is running online) to create an IOT system.

The idea is to make 2 versions, one simpler one with Arduino IDE, and one more complex with ESP32 or PlatformIO. 

The constraints are that the system needs to make use of free services, so it can be replicated for educational purposes by anyone with access to the hardware.

Makes use of https://github.com/zenhall/DAZI-AI for the Arduino project and inspiration for solving common problems
